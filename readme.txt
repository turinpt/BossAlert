How to use:

This addon will read the text in your tooltip box, alert the guild and play a sound once something spawns under your mouse.
This means your mouse pointer NEEDS to be where the boss will spawn. Works while your character is dead as well.

"This addon is allowed as long as you respect the ToU with it." -Daemon
This means no multiboxing and no automation to prevent AFK disconnects.
